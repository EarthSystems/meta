05.06.2018 20:59:18, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: Thanks for setting this up Malik
06.06.2018 11:04:04, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): I created a trello team/board as well to create and track action items. I figure we all probably need a day or two for travelling and decompression, but would certainly like to see this group continue to work together and brainstorm! I think starting with the Who/What/Where/When/Why of a mission statement would be a great first step, as would creating a version controlled living document on Github/Gitlab. Will have more time to expand upon this on the weekend :)  http://bit.ly/EarthSystems
06.06.2018 11:06:08, Michael Longoria [@kaon_x]: Awesome, thanks Malik and Clinton. Great meeting everyone and excited to continue the conversation.....06.06.2018 15:54:36, Alexei Camacho Ramirez [@Alexei_C]: >>unsupported service message type: messageActionChatJoinedByLink<<
07.06.2018 13:28:26, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: Awesome Cilnton thanks for taking the next step! There are 18 of us in this group which is about the amount we had in the room, does anyone notice a missing name?
07.06.2018 14:02:43, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: I believe we were assigned by the folks at the summit. They have that list?
07.06.2018 14:02:50, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: As a*
07.06.2018 14:26:35, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: I already contacted one of the organizers about sending the invite link to everyone but haven't heard back yet
07.06.2018 14:54:34, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: 👍
07.06.2018 20:05:08, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: Hi everyone! Thanks Malik for setting this up!
08.06.2018 10:00:57, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): [[Webpage]]Hello @heidicuppari Was http://dreamtank.co/ the project Summer had mentioned?
08.06.2018 10:22:25, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: [[Webpage]]I highly recommend everyone read this book Reinventing Organizations. If we really want to change how our society works we need to change the way we come together as people.

09.06.2018 17:25:17, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: Yes! That’s it!
10.06.2018 08:25:58, Angela del Sol [@angeladelsol]: Hi everyone! @angeladelsol here! It was pleasure being part of this discussion. Look forward catalyzing this energy and collaborating and helping each-other reach our goals.
11.06.2018 10:13:44, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): [[Webpage]]Looks like a good book, I'll add it to my list! Thanks Malik. I'd also recommend https://basecamp.com/books/rework if you're into this type of reading.
11.06.2018 10:15:24, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): I heard about this virtual conference on Blockchain, I've attended a few years now and they have some good presentations. I have an extra invite if anyone is interested. https://hacksummit.org/
11.06.2018 10:20:57, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): [[Webpage]]Also, created a github organization for EarthSystems - https://github.com/EarthSystems/ - I have been talking to Gavin Starks who is looking to support SDG-focused startups and projects, he's interested in hearing more ideas so don't be shy! :).....12.06.2018 08:56:13, Gregory Landua [@cpt_grog]: >>unsupported service message type: messageActionChatJoinedByLink<<
12.06.2018 08:56:29, Gregory Landua [@cpt_grog]: Hi team earth systems!
12.06.2018 09:42:07, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: Hello!! @cpt_grog Summer and I were just on the phone with Kiss The Ground - she and her partner Anya in their film company are doing a film for youth to activate and regenerate soil- and partnering up with them. Sounds like you are making a film with them too! We may have the makings of a great multi faceted campaign here!
12.06.2018 10:42:41, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: Is anyone here officially with Blockchain for Impact?
12.06.2018 11:08:27, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: I can reach out and see if we can get a rep to join if needed. Of course this will be an autonomous org but we need to coordinate with the mothership
12.06.2018 11:26:02, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): I have Estefania and Sergio’s contacts but haven’t heard anything since the summit
12.06.2018 11:42:04, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: Yea would be interested to know about what they're thinking for follow up and continuing
12.06.2018 12:17:13, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: Yea I've reached out to a few organizers and haven't gotten responses about how to proceed
12.06.2018 12:21:13, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: 🤔
12.06.2018 13:00:20, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: Perfect emoji response! :)
12.06.2018 13:56:26, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: Lol yes
12.06.2018 14:07:20, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: Well if we don't hear anything, maybe we can figure something out :)
12.06.2018 14:16:22, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: How about reaching out to Ef and Cristina? I have their contacts. @kibagateaux  do you have an inquiry written for others your reached out to that I can easily forward? In transit and it would be super helpful
12.06.2018 14:16:31, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: Heidi@anastasiaimpact.com
12.06.2018 14:16:51, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: If not I’ll write them later
12.06.2018 14:45:36, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: The people I reached out to I know personally so it was pretty casual. Basically just said:

"hey, we are doing this thing! what are your guidelines, how do we stay involved and connected"
12.06.2018 15:35:50, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: Thanks Malik
12.06.2018 15:36:14, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: @heidicuppari maybe you also reach out? If we have a couple inquiries maybe it will spur action ;)
12.06.2018 19:17:49, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): I have Ef’s as well in an email chain. I’ll email him and Sergio, and a few on Esri’s UN team in the AM and see if there’s a follow up plan.
12.06.2018 19:20:03, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): But yes the more interest the better, so please Heidi email as well if you have the time. That’s so cool that you’re both making movies! Wow haha
12.06.2018 21:00:42, Malik Wormsby [@kibagateaux]: I'll follow up with my people again too
12.06.2018 21:14:50, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: Sent email to Ef and Cristina
13.06.2018 09:27:47, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): Email sent
13.06.2018 09:28:24, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: I wonder if the other working groups also started channels and are asking?
13.06.2018 09:28:34, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: Anyone know any of the moderators for the other groups?
13.06.2018 13:25:33, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: I know Holly Ruxin was in financial inclusion - can reach out
14.06.2018 08:52:16, Michael Smith: Team!! Sincere apologies for missing last Monday. I am healing and feeling better and excited to see what’s transpiring here!
14.06.2018 08:59:08, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): Hi Michael, thanks for joining! Glad to hear you’re feeling better. Malik suggested we keep in touch in this chat so we can share our projects and support one another, while looking for opportunities to work together to advance the SDGs.
14.06.2018 09:38:23, Michael Smith: Excellent. Is there a way to see what’s been posted already?
14.06.2018 09:43:58, Michael Smith: My goal with branding this “Earth Systems” vs environment/sustainability/climate was to forge a new narrative. Looking at the earth as an operating system makes it easier to leap to accepting a shared ledger accumulating the immense task of accounting all emissions and drawdown sources in real time globally
14.06.2018 09:45:48, Michael Smith: To be clear, the goal of this group is to take best learnings from all failed past carbon markets and apply them to the most promising (such as Greg’s regen, climate coin Et al)
14.06.2018 09:45:54, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): I think there’s a way to export the chat history from the API, I’ll see if I can get it
14.06.2018 09:46:50, Michael Smith: We need a single #13 climate action currency that will become the global standard. No one owns it. Because every owns it
14.06.2018 09:50:30, Clinton Dow [@geomancer42](you): I had some ideas that I wanted to discuss around that topic. I have been working with an OGC group to help advance a Digital Earth model that carries on work by Michael Goodchild and Al Gore.
14.06.2018 10:39:31, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: Ok talked to someone who was in financial inclusion who said it was a disaster- they are not organized past last Monday.
14.06.2018 10:45:40, Aaron B [@lucky_s7evins]: Does that suggest there isn't an outline for next steps?
14.06.2018 11:04:37, Heidi Cuppari [@heidicuppari]: I don’t think anyone was given that, no, but it seems Michael may know more as he said above he branded this group :)
